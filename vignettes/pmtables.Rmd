pmtables is a package for R that automates the building and formatting of some
tables that we commonly create when reporting modeling and simulation results
in pharmacometrics. 


# Tables

pmtable currently supports three main types of tables

1. continuous covariate summary (see [continuous-table.html])
1. categorical / discrete covariate summary (see [discrete-table.html])
1. data set inventory summary (number of observations, number of individuals, 
   etc) (see [data-inventory.html])
